Online transactions have made payments faster and more convenient, but they also come with several issues. Many users face problems like payment failure, double debiting, delayed refunds, or transaction timeouts due to technical glitches or poor internet connectivity. Security concerns such as phishing, fraud, and unauthorized access also affect the trust of customers in digital payment systems. Sometimes, money gets deducted from the account but does not reach the receiver immediately, causing frustration and financial stress. To overcome these challenges, it is important to ensure secure platforms, proper grievance redressal systems, and awareness among users about safe digital practices.
